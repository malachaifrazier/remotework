Source code for http://www.remotelyawesomejobs.com

This is a scraper site that aggregates remote job postings on various job
boards around the internet. These things are popping up like flies, so
I decided to make my own for fun.

Because this is a fun side project, there aren't a lot of specs. _Caveat emptor_.
